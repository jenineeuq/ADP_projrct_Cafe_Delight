# ‚òï Cafe Delight ‚Äì Coffee Ordering Web App

**Cafe Delight** is a college project that simulates a real-world caf√© ordering system. It allows users to browse a menu of different coffee types and place orders in a simple, elegant interface. Designed to replicate a digital menu system for caf√©s, this project emphasizes usability and clean UI.

## üí° Problem Statement

In many small caf√©s, there‚Äôs a lack of a digital system for ordering coffee. Customers have to wait for staff, read printed menus, or rely on verbal communication. This project aims to provide a **basic digital interface** that allows customers to **view, customize, and order coffee** easily.
